Perfect ✅ — we’ll keep all namespaces exactly as `Riyad\Polypay` in the documentation.

Here’s the **full Laravel-style, framework-agnostic, guided README.md** for your package:

# Polypay – Framework-Agnostic Payment Abstraction for PHP
**Built for Bangladeshi gateways first. Flexible enough for the world.**

Polypay provides a clean, unified API for integrating multiple payment gateways in any PHP application. It is framework-agnostic, so you can use it in **vanilla PHP**, **Laravel**, **Symfony**, or any other framework. While initially focused on Bangladeshi gateways, it is flexible enough to support international gateways as well.

## Installation

Install Polypay using Composer:

```bash
composer require riyad/polypay
````
